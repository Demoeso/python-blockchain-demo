# Python Blockchain Prototype

This is a simple blockchain demo written in Python. It includes:

- SHA-512 hashing
- Proof-of-work mining logic
- Block validation
- Basic tamper detection

Run the `blockchain.py` file to simulate adding blocks and testing validity.

> This is a learning project to demonstrate core blockchain logic in a simple and readable format.
